    "## Introduction\n",
    "Dolly Sods Wilderness is a forest in West Virginia, and I go camping there pretty much every year. It is notably wet and boggy, especially in the northern area of the forest, yet it can be difficult to find streams from which to filter drinking water, especially since some that are marked on the map are only ephemeral (only contain water after rainfall) or seasonal (only contain water several months out of the year). I want to conduct a hydrology assessment using DEMs to better understand where I could get water (and avoid boggy ground) the next time I go camping.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various hydrological factors that can be derived from a DEM, however for the scope of this project I will stick to Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) and stream delineation. Stream delineation is a relatively straightforward process and TWI can be calculated using a rescaled flow accumulation raster (Chowdhury, 2023)."

    "Dolly Sods Wilderness is located in eastern West Virginia, right next to Canaan Valley and Timberline Resort. It is roughly rectangular, with the northern portion being an alpine meadow ecosystem and the southern portion more of a temperate forest. The upper portion can get quite boggy in certain areas, the soil has poor drainage, while the southern area is bisected by Red Creek, a relatively fast flowing stream. The northern portion does not contain much fast-flowing water, meaning if you plan to camp there you need to pack in water. The southern portion has various tributaries of Red Creek running through it, and it is easy to find a campsite near water."

    "According to Riihimaki et al., the flow routing algorithm used in Flow Direction is very important to the final result. Arcpy offers 3 different algorithms: D8, Multiple Flow Direction (MFD), and D-Infinity (Dinf). Riihimaki et al. state that D8 is the most simplistic flow routing algorithm; while they tested more algorithms in addition to these three, their findings suggest that from these three, Dinf will perform the best.\n",

    "DEM resolution is another factor that influences the TWI result. Interestingly, Riihimaki et al. found that the highest DEM resolution they tested (1m, which happens to be our DEM resolution) did not perform the best. They attributed this to lidar errors, because the point spacing was roughly equivalent to cell size. They found that Dinf reached its maximal explanatory power at 3m resolution. As a result, resampling the DEM to 3m is included in this TWI workflow, as well as the Dinf algorithm"

He also notes that below 1,000, defining catchement area becomes questionable, especially in regions of flat terrain.\n",

While this minimum threshold and step values are arbitrary, I believe they cover both uncertain and certain stream outputs, while keeping number of output datasets low."

Our measure of model accuracy will be the percentage of accurate pixels, or total number of overlapping pixels divided by total pixels in the stream network.

    "## Discussion\n",
    "According to the above graph, the prediction accuracy is highest for a threshold of 5,000, and decreases as the threshold gets larger. This is interesting, as the literature suggests otherwise. As previously discussed, Maidment states that a higher threshold means there are more upstream cells contributing flow into that cell. This should make it more likely that the cell is a part of an established water channel, and therefore more likely to show up on a map or in this case, a national hydrography dataset.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Instead, 5,000, the lowest threshold (with less upstream contributing cells), has the highest accuracy at approximately 12%. The lowest was 505,000 at approximately 4%. There seems to be more going on behind the scenes here.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "One possible factor influencing these results is in the accuracy metric itself: it is a binary presence/absence measure, which fails to account for the numerous false positives and negatives that are seen at lower threshold levels. See below, where we compare Observed streams with Predicted at the highest (505,000) and lowest (5,000) thresholds. While the 5,000 threshold has the highest accuracy, we can see it also has many more false positive pixels than the 505,000 threshold.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Further accuracy assessment would give deeper insight here. For example, instead of using a binary mask for the observed streams, reclassifying it to values of 3 and 5 for absence and presence, respectively, and then reclassifying the predicted stream networks to values of 2 and 4 for absence and presence, respectively would allow for a simple map algebra multiplication; this would yield a confusion matrix of the total true positive and negatives, and false positives and negatives. Each threshold could then be scored according to this more in-depth metric."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Hydrology analysis not a straightforward process and depends on many assumptions about your study area. It is often a best-case scenario, and the results are suggestions more than they are fact. This particular analysis would have been greatly helped by some field data. Many of the articles cited here relied on plots measuring soil moisture or stream width, and used these in evaluating their model. Without this data, our findings are limited. Another limiting factor is the choice of flow routing algorithm. The main journal article discusses (Riihimaki et al.) evaluates 11 different flow routing algorithms in their analysis. ArcGIS only offers 3, and truly supports only the D8 (as many algorithms using flow direction as an input require it to be of integer data type, which the other two algorithms do not use). Building out a more sophisticated workflow in another GIS (e.g. SAGA GIS, the software used by Riihimaki et al.) should definitely be considered for a future analysis.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "I do feel I can go back to Dolly Sods as a more informed camper though. Calculating TWI showed me which areas are most likely to be marshy, which were mainly in the north of the forest, with an area in the southwest also looking pretty wet. The stream networks we calculated also showed tributaries that are not marked on the hydrography dataset we used as our observed data, so it will be interesting to ground truth these the next time I go. I suppose I will find out whether they are ephemeral streams, or perhaps just small depressions that are a little more likely to contain water than the surrounding area.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "It would be interesting to revisit this analysis with an updated flow routing workflow, field data and an updated model evaluation method."
